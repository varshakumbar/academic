        <h2>About The Department</h2>
        <p>
            Vinod Gupta School of Management (VGSoM) was set up as the first school of management within the IIT system in 1993, 
            with the help of a distinguished alumnus & a lifetime Fellow of the Institute, Mr. Vinod Gupta (B. Tech. 1967), 
            the former CEO and Chairman of InfoGROUP (previously known as InfoUSA) whose generous endowment of 2 Million US Dollars 
            was matched by liberal support from the Government of India. The mission of the school is to develop outstanding 
            management professionals capable of playing leadership roles in their chosen careers in organisations in different 
            sectors of the economy, especially in technology-driven and knowledge-based industries that are characterized by high 
            degrees of globalisation, dynamism, complexity, and innovativeness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The school offers a Doctoral programme in management (PhD) and an MBA programme for working executives over weekends 
            in Kolkata and Bhubaneswar. The school also regularly organizes guest lectures, Management Development Programmes (MDPs), 
            and training programs for educators in India and abroad. The school also offers a unique need-based scholarship to its 
            students with the sole aim to ensure access of deserving students to world-class management training. Highly qualified 
            faculty with outstanding academic credentials and diverse industrial/consultancy experience associate with colleagues in 
            India and abroad to provide the best possible learning environment to our students. Faculty also contribute to the 
            knowledge base through their research and consultancy projects with their partners in the industry and academics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, more than two decades after its inception, the school has grown holistically, winning several accolades and setting 
            up new benchmarks for excellence. As a part of the world-renowned IIT Kharagpur system, the school enjoys access to 
            state-of-the-art infrastructure, one of the most well-equipped libraries in the country, and a very large, well-established 
            network of alumni. Please visit our beautiful campus and meet us to know more. You are also welcome to contact us at
