        Students of engineering often aim to pursue careers in areas and domains that are in high focus 
        within industry. In recognition of their aspirations, the Institute is offering interdisciplinary 
        programs, wherein students can opt for them either as regular degree programs or as Microspecializations.
        </p>
        <p>
        This provides an academic opportunity for current and future students to gain competencies across
         disciplines and enables them to make career choices irrespective of their qualifying degree. 
         Interdisciplinary subjects cover a wide range of highly relevant areas and use the unique diversity
          of academic units and research capability at IIT KGP.
        </p>
        <p>
        Currently the Institute has two avenues of interdisciplinary academics

    <h2>Switch Over to Interdisciplinary Dual Degree</h2>
    <p>
      Students admitted to the 4-year B. Tech.(Hons.) / 5-year Dual Degree Program through JEE(Advanced) are 
      eligible for Switch Over to the Dual Degree Programs of Engineering Entrepreneurship, Financial
       Engineering and at the end of 2nd year. Students admitted to the 4-year B. Tech.(Hons.) / 4-year BS 
       Program through JEE(Advanced) are eligible for Switch over to Dual Degree in Artificial Intelligence
        and Machine Learning (AIML) at the end of 3rd year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similar to Switchover to Interdisciplinary Dual Degree, students of Dual Degree & 5yr Integrated MSc
       & 4 yr BS students can switchover to Petroleum Engineering at the end of 2nd year. The students of B 
       Tech in Mechanical Engineering/ Chemical Engineering/ Mining Engineering can switch over to M Tech in
        Petroleum Engineering with B Tech in parent department. The students of 5 yr Integrated MSc and 4 yr
         BS in Geology/Geophysics can switchover to 6 Year Integrated MSc-M Tech Programme (with MTech in
          Petroleum Engineering).

  <h2 class="heading-dis">Microspecializations</h2>
  <div class="content1-dis">
    <p>
      Interdisciplinary Dual Degree programs - Such a program offers interdisciplinary exposure while the student pursues two degrees which are awarded in a consolidated time period. While the B.Tech is undertaken in one major discipline the M.Tech can be undertaken in another discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students who have taken admission to a 4-year B.Tech/5 year Dual Degree program can opt for an Interdisciplinary Dual Degree at the end of their first year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The placement record for Interdisciplinary Dual Degree students has been impressive over the years as the courses have proved to enhance their employability. At IIT KGP a student can do a B.Tech in any engineering discipline and pursue an interdisciplinary course in one of the following disciplines:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-dis">
      <li>M.Tech. in Financial Engineering</li>
      <li>M.Tech. in Engineering Entrepreneurship</li>
      <li>M.Tech. in Transdisciplinary Programme in Petroleum Engineering (TPPE) (to be introduced shortly)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, the Dual Degree Program in Quality Engineering and Engineering Design is a unique program that offers two verticals, one in Mechanical Engineering and the other in Industrial Electronics.
